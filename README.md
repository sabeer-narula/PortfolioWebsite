# Welcome to Sabeer Narula's Personal Portfolio Website Repository

Hello there! I'm glad you've stumbled upon the GitHub repository for [sabeernarula.com](https://sabeernarula.com), my personal slice of the internet where I showcase my skills, hobbies, job experiences, and various projects I've poured my heart into.

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that makes WebGL simpler, enabling 3D visualizations right in the browser.
- **Vite**: An incredibly fast front-end build tool, leveraging modern web technologies for a seamless development experience.
- **CI/CD**: Integrated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with Vercel, automatically deploying the latest changes from the repository to the live website upon every commit.
